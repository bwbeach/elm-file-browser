# elm-file-browser

This is my first Elm project after working through the examples
in [Elm in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action).

## How to Run

First, compile the Elm code into Javascript:

```
elm make src/Main.elm --output app.js
```

The run the reactor and open the page:

```
elm reactor
open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```
